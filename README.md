# NearestStationsFinder
With this PHP script you can find the nearest station using a GET parameter with coordinates (lat/lon).

It is using a database for MariaDB/MySQL where the coordinates and stations are stored. 
Further you'll need to have an account for the NS-API. You can create an account here, and then you can 
generate a key: https://apiportal.ns.nl/
